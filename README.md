# Coding Notes
These are notes about coding and related concepts. They are written idiosyncratically; they make sense to me, they may not make sense to you. But please correct me you spot something outright wrong.

I often need to quickly remind myself about several ideas, which is why I decided to keep my notes in browser-readable format rather than use something like Evernote. Also Evernote is horrible at code formatting.
