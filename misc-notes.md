# Misc. Notes

## Controlling Flow
Ternary conditional expressions are cool. Remember the syntax:

`[boolean to be evaluated] ? [do this if true] : [do this if false]`

Use 'case' instead of endless ifs, elsifs, else. when/then is a nice compact, readable version of endless ifs and elses.

## User Interaction in Ruby

## Parallel Assignment
(to be written)

## Shovel Operator
(to be written)

## String Interpolation
String interpolation (`#{var}`) doesn't work on strings enclosed in single quotes.

## Classes
The canonical form of an object.

## Modules
Modules are like classes but they can't create instances. They're only used for storing things (constants).

## Mixins
When you use a module to add information to a class.
